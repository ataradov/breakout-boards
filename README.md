## Breakout Boards

This is a collection of random breakout boards I developed to get started with a new device.

Firmware for the SAM D11 used as a debugger/VCP interface on some boards is available [here](https://github.com/ataradov/free-dap))

### Currrently available boards:

* Atmel SAME70 / SAMS70
* ST STM32G071
* GigaDevice GD32F407V (will probably work for STM32F407 as well)
