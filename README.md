## Breakout Boards

This is a collection of random breakout boards I developed to get started with a new device.

### Currrently available boards:

* Atmel SAME70 / SAMS70
* ST STM32G071 (Firmware for the SAM D11 used as a debugger/VCP interface is available [here](https://github.com/ataradov/free-dap))
